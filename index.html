            <h3>Food for a family</h3>
            <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado, flood, hurricane or blizzard. Bangladeshi families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from being prepared in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few days after the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.</p>

            <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
            <p>Emergency shelters or transitional shelters are a common issue in the aftermath of disasters. Worldwide, millions of houses are damaged or destroyed by disasters every year. People are forced to leave their homes and seek refuge, sometimes for short time and sometimes for a protracted period based on the nature of the disaster and the extent of the damage done to the housing structures. With the varying levels of affordability of the affected population as well as the external assistance provided, the time for reconstruction of houses might take even months</p>

            <h3>Education for a child</h3>
            <p>Floods come in various forms and are living testimonies of the conflict between urban development and weather-related vulnerabilities. Floods, which in recent years have taken the world by surprise, come into the discussion too. While that is the case, its impact on education systems is least discussed, if ever, yet literature acknowledges floods as one of the most devastating disasters ever recorded in human history. </p>
